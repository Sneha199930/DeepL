# Deep-Learning

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Deep learning (DL) is the type of machine learning (ML) that resembles human brains where it learns from data by using artificial neural networks. Just like human brains, these deep neural networks learn from real life examples. In a few cases it has surpassed human intelligence, just like Google's AlphaGo has defeated number one Go Player Ke Jie. DL uses multiple neural network layers to process larger amounts of data and predict results with high accuracy. It has become the industry standard as it is now used in self-driving cars, fraud detection and forecasting weather.
